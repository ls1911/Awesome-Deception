# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Since this is an "Awesome List" project and consists mainly of a README file, 
the concept of "supported versions" might be a bit different. We don't have multiple versions, 
but we're committed to keeping the list updated, secure, and free of vulnerabilities.

| Version  | Supported         |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Latest   | :white_check_mark: |
| Previous | :x:               |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security issues (even though it's just a list!), 
please report them by opening an issue or reaching out directly. We're a friendly bunch, and you'll get a response within 48 hours. 
If accepted, we'll patch it and give you a shoutout in the README. If declined, we'll explain why.

Stay awesome, and thanks for keeping this list secure! ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”’
